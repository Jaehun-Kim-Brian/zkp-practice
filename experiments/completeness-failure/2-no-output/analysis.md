# Analysis: Completeness Failure — Hidden Output (No signal output declared)

## Experiment Overview

- **Circuit**: `multiplier_incomplete_2.circom`
- The core constraint `c <== a * b` **is present**
- However, the signal `c` is **not declared as `signal output`**, so the verifier has **no acess** to the result of the multiplication.

---

## Proof & Verification Results

- Witness generation: Success
- Proof generation: Success
- Verification result: `[INFO] snarkJS: OK!` → **Verifier accepted the proof**

---

## Problem Analysis

- The prover computes `c = 12` honestly using `a = 3` and `b = 4`, and the constraint enforces this correctly.
- However, since `c` is not marked as an output signal, the verifier has **no way of knowing** what value was actually computed.
- As a result, the verifier accepts the proof **without understanding what has been proven**.

---

## Security Interpretation

- Due to a **structural design flaw** in the circuit, the prover may indeed prove a true statement,
but the verifier **has no observable evidence** of what that statement was. 
- In this case, although completeness is not formally violated (since the proof is valid), it is **functionally meaningless** because the verifier learns nothing.
- This constitutes a case of **practical completeness failure**, where the success of the proof does not reflect any meaningful verification.
