# Analysis: Completeness Failure (Incomplete Multiplier)

## Experiment Overview

- **Circuit**: `multiplier_incomplete.circom`
- The core constraint `c <== a * b` is **omitted**, leaving the circuit unable to determine whether the statement is true or false.
-  Correct inputs were provided (`a=3`, `b=2`), but the circuit includes **no logic to verify** that they satisfy any meaningful relationship.

---

## Proof & Verification Results

- Witness generation: Success
- Proof generation: Success
- Verification result: `[INFO] snarkJS: OK!` â†’ **Verifier accepted the proof**

---

## Problem Analysis

- Since the circuit imposes **no meaningful constraints**, the prover can provide **any input**, and the verifier will still accept it.
- The prover is **not required to demonstrate the truth of the statement**, even if the inputs are correct.
- Thus, while the completeness property-*"If the statement is true, the prover can always generate a valid proof"*-is **formally satisfied**, it becomes **practically meaningless** in this context.

---

## Security Interpretation

- The prover **did not actually prove** that they can perform the multiplication correctly, yet the verifier accepted the proof.
- As a result, the verifier's acceptance is **semantically meaningless**/
- This also hints ata a **potential soundness risk**:
  the verifier may accept a proof even when **invalid computation** was performed
